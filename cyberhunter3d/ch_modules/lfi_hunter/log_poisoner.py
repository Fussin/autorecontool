    Placeholder for attempting log poisoning via LFI.
    Conceptually, this would involve injecting a payload into a log file
    and then trying to include that log file via an LFI vulnerability.

    Args:
        target_url (str): The target URL with the LFI vulnerability.
        param_name (str | None): The LFI vulnerable parameter.
        lfi_payload_to_log_file (str | None): The LFI payload that successfully includes a known log file
                                             (e.g., '../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log').
                                             This would be identified by other LFI checks first.

    Returns:
        list: A list of potential LFI to RCE findings via log poisoning (empty for placeholder).
