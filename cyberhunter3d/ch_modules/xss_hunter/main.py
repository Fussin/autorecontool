    """
    Placeholder function for XSS hunting.
    This function will simulate running XSS detection tools against a list of URLs.

    Args:
        target_urls_file (str): Path to a file containing live URLs (e.g., urls_alive_file from recon).
        output_dir (str): The directory to save the output 'xss_vulnerabilities.json' file.
                          This should be the specific target's output directory.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the path to the 'xss_vulnerabilities.json' file and a status.
