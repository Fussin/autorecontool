    Compiles a placeholder XXE report.

        conceptual_findings (dict): A dictionary where keys are XXE technique types
                                   (e.g., "basic_entity_injection", "oob_detection")

        output_dir (str): The directory to save the report.
        report_file_name (str): The name of the report file.
