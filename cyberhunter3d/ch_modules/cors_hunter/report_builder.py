    """
    Compiles a placeholder CORS report.
    In this placeholder phase, it primarily writes the standard "notes" section.
    The 'conceptual_findings' dictionary is expected to be a collection of lists from other CORS sub-modules,
    but will be empty in this placeholder implementation.

    Args:
        conceptual_findings (dict): A dictionary where keys are CORS technique types
                                   and values are lists of mock finding strings/dicts.
        output_dir (str): The directory to save the report.
        report_file_name (str): The name of the report file.

    Returns:
        dict: Dictionary containing path to 'cors_vulnerabilities.json' and status,
              or just the path if successful.
