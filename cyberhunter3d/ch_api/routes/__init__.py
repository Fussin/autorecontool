# CyberHunter 3D - API Routes Package
# This __init__.py can be used to make 'routes' a package.
# You might import blueprints here or just use it to structure route files.

# Example:
# from .scan_routes import scan_bp
# from .user_routes import user_bp

# __all__ = ['scan_bp', 'user_bp'] # If you want to control imports with *
pass
